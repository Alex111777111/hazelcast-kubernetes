hazelcast-kubernetes
====================

Hazelcast clustering for Kubernetes made easy.

## Pre-requisites

* Docker 1.3+
* Kubernetes cluster

## Kubernetes cluster

You can use GCE or a local cluster. For a local cluster on MacOS X or Linux, just hit [this other repository from yours truly](https://github.com/pires/kubernetes-vagrant-coreos-cluster).

## Build Docker image

The image is already available at [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/pires/hazelcast-k8s/). You can:

```
docker pull pires/hazelcast-k8s
```

But if you feel like building it yourself:

```
docker build -t hazelcast-k8s:0.1 .
```

## Deploy

### Service 

So that you can access the cluster, you need to deploy a ```service```.

**GCE**
```
gcloud preview container services create --config-file=hazelcast-k8s-service.json
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubectl create -f hazelcast-k8s-service.json
```

Confirm service has been created:

**GCE**
```
gcloud preview container services list
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubecfg list services
```


### Replication Controller

Let's start with a 1-replica controller:

**GCE**

```
gcloud preview container replicationcontrollers create --config-file=hazelcast-k8s-controller.json
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubectl create -f hazelcast-k8s-controller.json
```

Check the ```pods``` list:

**GCE**
```
gcloud preview container pods list
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubecfg list pods
```

You should see one replica of an Hazelcast node.

Let's now scale it up:

**GCE**
```
gcloud preview container replicationcontrollers resize hazelcast --num-replicas=3
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubecfg resize hazelcast 3
```

Check the ```pods``` list once more.

After all pods are running, and by inspecting their logs, you should confirm that Hazelcast nodes are connected to each other.

**GCE**
```
gcloud preview container kubectl log <pod identifier> hazelcast
```

**Local cluster**
```
kubectl log <pod identifier> hazelcast
```

You should see something like:

```

## Accessing cluster

The service should now be available at ```$HAZELCAST_SERVICE_HOST```:```$HAZELCAST_SERVICE_PORT```. Of course, this is only accessible from inside the cluster (say, another pod).
