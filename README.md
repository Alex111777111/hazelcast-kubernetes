hazelcast-kubernetes
====================

Hazelcast clustering for Kubernetes made easy.

Lean (186MB) JRE 8 + Hazelcast 3.4.2 + Kubernetes Hazelcast discovery Docker image, based on progrium/busybox.

## Pre-requisites

* Docker 1.5+
* Kubernetes 0.16.2+ cluster

## Kubernetes cluster

You can test with a local cluster. Check [this other repository from yours truly](https://github.com/pires/kubernetes-vagrant-coreos-cluster).

## Docker image

The image is already available at [Docker Hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/pires/hazelcast-k8s/)

## Deploy

### Service

So that you can access the cluster, you need to deploy a ```service```.

```
kubectl create -f hazelcast-service.yaml
```

Confirm service has been created:

```
kubecfg list services
```

### Replication Controller

Let's start with a 1-replica controller:

```
kubectl create -f hazelcast-controller.yaml
```

Check the ```pods``` list:

```
kubectl list pods
```

You should see **one** Hazelcast pod.

Let's scale it up:

```
kubectl resize --replicas=3 replicationcontroller hazelcast
```

Check the ```pods``` list once more.

After all pods are running, and by inspecting their logs, you should confirm that Hazelcast nodes are connected to each other.

```
kubectl log <pod identifier> hazelcast
```

You should see something like:

```

## Accessing cluster

The service should now be available at ```$HAZELCAST_SERVICE_HOST```:```$HAZELCAST_SERVICE_PORT```. Of course, this is only accessible from inside the cluster (say, another pod).
